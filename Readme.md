This simple iOS demo app shows how you can interact between VLCKit and SwiftUI.

- Requires that you add MobileVLCKit Cocoapod to this TestVLCKitIOS project (which will create the required Xcode workspace) before you can launch (see: https://github.com/videolan/vlckit before running).

Test environment:

 - MacOS Ventura 13.2.1
 - iOS 16.2 (Xcode simulator)
 - Xcode 14.2
 - MobileVLCKit 3.3.17
